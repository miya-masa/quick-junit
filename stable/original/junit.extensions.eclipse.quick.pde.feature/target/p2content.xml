        Common Public License Version 1.0&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS&#xA;COMMON PUBLIC&#xA;LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION&#xA;OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are&#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos;&#xA;from a&#xA;Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor&#xA;itself or anyone&#xA;acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include&#xA;additions to&#xA;the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in&#xA;conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,&#xA;and (ii) are not&#xA;derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;which are&#xA;necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution&#xA;alone or when&#xA;combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;Agreement,&#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright&#xA;license to&#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly&#xA;perform,&#xA;distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,&#xA;if any, and such&#xA;derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license&#xA;under Licensed&#xA;Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise&#xA;transfer the&#xA;Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and&#xA;object code form.&#xA;This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution&#xA;and the&#xA;Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,&#xA;such&#xA;addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered&#xA;by the&#xA;Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other&#xA;combinations&#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed&#xA;hereunder.&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;the licenses&#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided&#xA;by any&#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or&#xA;other intellectual&#xA;property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims&#xA;any liability to&#xA;Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement&#xA;of&#xA;intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to&#xA;exercising the&#xA;rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby&#xA;assumes sole&#xA;responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights&#xA;needed, if any.&#xA;For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow&#xA;Recipient to&#xA;distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;that license&#xA;before distributing the Program.&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient&#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright&#xA;license set&#xA;forth in this Agreement.&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its&#xA;own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties&#xA;and&#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions&#xA;of title and&#xA;non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability&#xA;and&#xA;fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability&#xA;for&#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and&#xA;consequential&#xA;damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;are offered&#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;such&#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable&#xA;manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;the Program. &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained&#xA;within the&#xA;Program.&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if&#xA;any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients&#xA;to identify the&#xA;originator of the Contribution.&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA;with&#xA;respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this&#xA;license is&#xA;intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the&#xA;Contributor who&#xA;includes the Program in a commercial product offering should&#xA;do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if&#xA;a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,&#xA;such&#xA;Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend&#xA;and indemnify&#xA;every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any&#xA;losses, damages&#xA;and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits&#xA;and other legal&#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor&#xA;to the&#xA;extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor&#xA;in&#xA;connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial&#xA;product&#xA;offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any&#xA;claims or Losses&#xA;relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.&#xA;In order&#xA;to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify&#xA;the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial&#xA;Contributor to&#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the&#xA;defense and any&#xA;related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor&#xA;may participate in&#xA;any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial&#xA;product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that&#xA;Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties&#xA;related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties&#xA;are such&#xA;Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section,&#xA;the&#xA;Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the&#xA;other&#xA;Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties,&#xA;and if a court&#xA;requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result,&#xA;the Commercial&#xA;Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN&#xA;&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,&#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR&#xA;IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each&#xA;Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness&#xA;of using and&#xA;distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with&#xA;its exercise of&#xA;rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the&#xA;risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data,&#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of&#xA;operations.&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY&#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,&#xA;INCIDENTAL,&#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION LOST&#xA;PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER&#xA;IN CONTRACT,&#xA;STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)&#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS&#xA;GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable&#xA;law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the&#xA;remainder of the&#xA;terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties&#xA;hereto, such&#xA;provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to&#xA;make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor&#xA;with respect to&#xA;a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim&#xA;in a&#xA;lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor&#xA;to such Recipient&#xA;under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation&#xA;is filed. In&#xA;addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any&#xA;entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program&#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software&#xA;or hardware)&#xA;infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights&#xA;granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is&#xA;filed.&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to&#xA;comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement&#xA;and does&#xA;not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming&#xA;aware of&#xA;such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement&#xA;terminate,&#xA;Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program&#xA;as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement&#xA;and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program&#xA;shall continue and&#xA;survive.&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,&#xA;but in&#xA;order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and&#xA;may only be&#xA;modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves&#xA;the right to&#xA;publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement&#xA;from time to time.&#xA;No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify&#xA;this Agreement.&#xA;IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility&#xA;to serve&#xA;as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each&#xA;new version of the&#xA;Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The&#xA;Program (including&#xA;Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version&#xA;of the Agreement&#xA;under which it was received. In addition, after a new version&#xA;of the Agreement&#xA;is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program&#xA;(including its&#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated&#xA;in Sections&#xA;2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses&#xA;to the&#xA;intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,&#xA;whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights&#xA;in the Program not&#xA;expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York&#xA;and the&#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No&#xA;party to this&#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more&#xA;than one year&#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights&#xA;to a jury trial in&#xA;any resulting litigation.
