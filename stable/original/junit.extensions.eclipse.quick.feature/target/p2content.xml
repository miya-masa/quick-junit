        Common Public License Version 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC&#xA;LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;    i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;    ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are&#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a&#xA;Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone&#xA;acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to&#xA;the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in&#xA;conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not&#xA;derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are&#xA;necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,&#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to&#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,&#xA;distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed&#xA;Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the&#xA;Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.&#xA;This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the&#xA;Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such&#xA;addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations&#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses&#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any&#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual&#xA;property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to&#xA;Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of&#xA;intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the&#xA;rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.&#xA;For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to&#xA;distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license&#xA;before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient&#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set&#xA;forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its&#xA;own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;    b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and&#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and&#xA;non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for&#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential&#xA;damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered&#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such&#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the&#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if&#xA;any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the&#xA;originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with&#xA;respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is&#xA;intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who&#xA;includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if&#xA;a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such&#xA;Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify&#xA;every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages&#xA;and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal&#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the&#xA;extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in&#xA;connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses&#xA;relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order&#xA;to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to&#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any&#xA;related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in&#xA;any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that&#xA;Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties&#xA;related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such&#xA;Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the&#xA;Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other&#xA;Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court&#xA;requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial&#xA;Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN&#xA;&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR&#xA;IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each&#xA;Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and&#xA;distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of&#xA;rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,&#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY&#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,&#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST&#xA;PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,&#xA;STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS&#xA;GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable&#xA;law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the&#xA;terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such&#xA;provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to&#xA;a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a&#xA;lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient&#xA;under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In&#xA;addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program&#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)&#xA;infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to&#xA;comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does&#xA;not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of&#xA;such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate,&#xA;Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement&#xA;and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and&#xA;survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in&#xA;order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be&#xA;modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to&#xA;publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.&#xA;No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.&#xA;IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve&#xA;as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the&#xA;Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including&#xA;Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement&#xA;under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement&#xA;is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its&#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections&#xA;2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the&#xA;intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not&#xA;expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the&#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this&#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year&#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in&#xA;any resulting litigation.
